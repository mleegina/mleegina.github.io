                <p>
                    Corporate clients and workplace teams could browse our platform to find unique experiences that fulfilled their specific
                    needs, like team bonding, recruitment, celebration, and client entertainment. The vendors on our platform
                    hosted a variety of non-traditional experiences, like an adult summer camp hosted by a stand-up comedian,
                    to a team photo shoot with a photographer.
                    <b>I needed to curate a diverse set of experiences that fulfilled varying corporate purposes, while screening
                        for quality.</b>
                    <br>

                    <br> The onboarding process started after an initial discovery call and interview. If the vendor seemed to
                    be a good fit,
                    <b>they filled out Typeforms: one detailed their
                        <a class="embed-link" href="https://bryandieudonne.typeform.com/to/s4VbWn">personal profile</a>
                        and the other outlined their event.</b> After the forms were completed, I reviewed the event and
                    noted my feedback. Another call would be scheduled with the vendor to go over the necessary changes.
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="text-spacing">The feedback loop was the longest and most problematic step. On average the entire process took 2 weeks,
                        but that was dependent on the number of revisions. </h3>


                    Vendors were frustrated with how long the onboarding process took, and gave up halfway through. In addition, I was heavily
                    involved throughout the entire process and spent most of my time communicating with vendors over the
                    phone and through email.
                    <b>My goal was to create a new process that would decrease onboarding time and have fewer vendors back out.</b>

                <p>
                    The users involved in the onboarding process consisted of the vendors who were hosting the event, their assistants, or other
                    office staff.
                    <b>The majority of our users were 25 - 40 years old, entrepreneurs or small-business owners, who were proficient
                        with technology.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Due to the differing needs of our users, most had to supplement their experience with extra information
                    regarding pricing and supplies.
                    <b>The type of information that each vendor required from their client was different.</b>
                    For example, the price of an tour is dependent on the number of people because the guide will need to arrange an appropriately
                    sized vehicle for transportation. On the other hand, a cook must be aware of any allergies or dietary
                    restrictions. A photographer might want to collect information on the guests, to bring appropriately
                    sized clothes and props.
                    <b>The forms needed to be open-ended to accommodate for all types of vendors.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Some vendors had their supporting staff fill out the forms. This caused some issues as I had not gotten
                    a chance to introduce them to our platform. These kinds of users asked very similar questions, inquiring
                    about sample responses, photos, or next steps.
                    <b>Because some vendors brought additional staff into the process, we needed a solution that would allow
                        us to communicate effectively with the entire group, and clearly outline the goals expectations for
                        those users who were unfamiliar with our platform.</b>

                        The form also functioned as a tutorial and was broken into several sections. Vendors could look through the examples, complete

                        Prior to an experience, vendors asked their clients clarifying questions in order to tailor the event to their needs. They
                        asked a combination of open-ended, multiple-choice, and yes or no questions. The open-ended nature
                        of the new form worked for each of our vendors as they had enough room to ask as many questions as
                        they needed to personalize the experience.
                        <b>When this step was moved online, instead of over the phone, I ended up getting more thoughtful and
                            complete answers, as the vendors did not feel rushed.</b>

                    <dd>
                        This document was stored in a shared drive folder, which was unique to the vendor. For security purposes the folder could
                        only be accessed by the vendor and the YVNT team. If the vendor had any other supporting documents,
                        they stored them in the folder along with the document for their experience. It was much easier to
                        organize and store multiple experiences along with their respective supporting documents.

                    <dd>
                        Multiple users were now able to edit the document, and it was easy to pinpoint who made each change as the history of each
                        of the edits was saved.

                        By storing the answers in a Google doc, the answers were automatically saved and the vendor could access them whenever they
                        needed.

                <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the living document solution was implemented, the profile and experience creation form were combined into a single document.
                    I noticed that the vendors were taking a longer time to get started with the process, perhaps because
                    it felt like a daunting task. I decided to test a separate version, where the profile portion would be
                    submitted through Typeform, and the experience portion would be completed through the Google Doc.
                    <br>
                    <br> I initially hypothesized the users would find it bothersome to have to complete the forms in two spots,
                    but I was surprised with results. Of the users in the hybrid group,
                    <b>80% completed the profile form first, and all of them went on to complete the second form.</b> In comparison,
                    the group that only used Google Docs only completed both parts 70% of the time. Granted, my sample size
                    was only 20 vendors, so my results might not have been the most accurate, but I was able to test quickly
                    and put the better solution in motion.

                    <h3 class="text-spacing">By breaking up the process into manageable chunks, users felt a sense of completion and were motivated
                        to complete the next steps.</h3>

                    On average the profile form took 10 minutes for the vendors to fill out. The information on this form included contact information,
                    their biography, and other personal information that was not likely to change.
                    <b>This made the profile form a good candidate for Typeform, rather than Google Docs which was more conducive
                        to change.</b> As an added bonus, I could download the responses from Typeform as an Excel spreadsheet,
                    which integrated nicely into my workflow.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>2. FEEDBACK SIMPLIFIED</h2>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/yvnt/comment.png">
                <p>
                    Google Docs lends itself well to giving feedback and making the necessary changes. While I evaluated experiences, I used
                    the commenting feature to note potential issues and areas where I needed more clarification.

                    <br>
                    <br> Vendors responded to these comments, and resolved them as they were addressed. Vendors made the appropriate
                    changes and were able to look through feedback on their own time.
                    <b>We no longer needed to coordinate and schedule calls to go over feedback.</b> I only needed to schedule
                    calls in specific cases where the experience was not fully flushed out by the vendor.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>3. GUIDED OBJECTIVES</h2>
                <div class="scroll-container">
                    <img id="infographic" src="../images/yvnt/info.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    If the vendor had an assistant or co-worker fill out the forms, we needed a way to communicate each step of the onboarding
                    process. This was achieved through an infographic that I created and attached in the onboarding welcome
                    email. It was a fun, visual way for the users to reference all the steps and could be easily shared with
                    colleagues.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">

                <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    The new onboarding process averaged
                    <b>4-5 days</b>, cutting down onboarding time by one week. The completion rate increased from
                    <b>60% to 90%</b>, with only 1 out of 10 vendors backing out of the process.
                    <br>


                    <br> There were still some inefficiencies that needed to be addressed.
                    <b>Exporting the information on the Google Docs was impossible to do efficiently, and this would become
                        even more challenging at scale.</b> In the future we had plans to handle all of this through a custom
                    built marketplace.

                    <br>
                    <br>This solution worked very well for me in my workflow, because
                    <b>I could integrate the downloaded vendor data from Typeform into Trello, where I was tracking each vendor
                        through my pipeline.</b> I also noticed that I had more time to gather vendor leads, as I did not
                    have to spend as much time on the phone answering questions and giving feedback. It was great to be able
                    to work from the same document at our convenience, and have the ability to track the history of what
                    had been discussed. I found that I was more productive, less stressed, and able to spend more time engaging
                    with vendors, growing our network.
