                    During operations,
                    <b>one staff member is dedicated to taking orders by phone.</b> While this system works for prepacked pints
                    and quarts, it has not scaled well for cake orders.
                    <b>Each order takes at least 15 minutes</b> as the employee guides the customer through a myriad of options.
                    Cakes themselves take an
                    <b>additional 40 minutes</b> of preparation time.

                    <h3 class="text-spacing">
                        In a business already struggling to keep up with demand, a night laden with cake orders can slow operations significantly,
                        resulting in a significant loss of efficiency and a potential loss of sales.
                    </h3>

                    Our proposed solution aims to assist Ferris Acres Creamery with their cake and large ice cream orders. The application is
                    designed to automate the process of gathering customer orders.
                    <b>By capturing orders online, it helps decrease the time and resources spent in collecting this information
                        via the phone and in-person.
                    </b> This in turn will allow Ferris Acres Creamery to collect data from more customers more efficiently.
                    Furthermore, by taking the order process online, it provides Ferris Acres Creamery with a consolidated
                    view of the order information along with the means to filter through it.

                    <a href="http://www.ferrisacrescreamery.com/">Ferris Acres Creamery</a> is small, family owned ice cream shop located in Southwest Connecticut. The
                    shop itself is unique because it is located within the farm.
                    <b>Visitors are treated to an authentic dairy farm experience</b>, complete with daily cow crossings, a
                    chance to interact with the animals, as well as fresh ice cream created from milk on the farm.
                    <b>Since its opening, the ice cream shop has been a massive success
                    </b>, requiring resources to be pulled from the primary farming business to support it. Numerous local
                    businesses sell the ice cream, and demand continues to grow.

                    <h3 class="text-spacing larger">Voted Best Ice Cream in Connecticut by Buzzfeed in 2016</h3>


                    The Ferris family manages the farm as a collective body, with Terry Ferris managing the whole operation. She manages around
                    <b>100 part-time employees</b> when they are open for the summer season which spans from April through October.
                    Her employees are usually high school students, or college students who are home for the summer, so
                    <b>staff turnover is high</b>. Mrs. Ferris was our primary point of contact for the duration of the project.

            <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/ferrisacres/gantt.png"> The 17-week project period was divided into several sprints. We defined the deliverables for each sprint, and
            <b>held weekly meetings with the client</b> where we discussed our progress. This approach provided the team with
            feedback and advice on the design and development completed after each sprint. Rapid prototyping was also used
            with deliverables, and we assigned deliverables to members with the most relevant experience.

            In early October one of our team members resigned from the project. His role was to be our main UI/UX designer as well a
            front-end developer, and so upon his departure I had to reassign tasks. The remaining members were already heavily
            involved in the system architecture and development, so I volunteered to assume his role. We had just started
            the design phase, so it was not difficult to transition into his role. At this time
            <b>we made the decision to use Bootstrap to simplify the development process</b>.
            <br>
            <br>The development of the prototype was progressing smoothly, until our lead full-stack developer had to take 3
            weeks off due to unforseen circumstances. His absence was strongly felt during this time, especially because
            he was unavailable for the first week. Instead of continuing development at this time, I decided it would be
            best for us to
            <b>QA and debug</b> our existing prototype. During the second and third week, our lead developer was available to
            work remotely and answer questions. Thankfully, my team stayed responsive despite our busy schedules, and we
            were able to work closely via Facebook Messenger.

                We decided to build a service-oriented platform on Node JS, which allowed the customer and administrative
                interface to be built as an
                <b>online, responsive order form across multiple devices</b>. The customer facing interface has a clean responsive
                design and is optimized to be used on touch based devices. The client interface places more emphasis on functionality
                rather than design as it will be used by employees internally. The key aspect of this interface is

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    I conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
                    <b>to assess the feasibility of the project and to measure the increased efficiency and lowered operational
                        costs</b>. In actuality, we did not receive any payment and this was simply a tool to quantify the
                    projected benefits and to see how practical it would be to implement.
                    <br>

                    <br>By using a risk-adjusted model, I estimated the
                    <b>internal rate of return (IRR) to be 400% over a five year period</b>. The total cost to be incurred over
                    the same period was estimated to be $22,000, but with an increase in revenue of nearly $200,000. Furthermore,
                    the team also estimated that Ferris Acres would
                    <b>save at least 1000 man hours</b> in their efforts in collecting cake orders.

                    <dd>
                        The largest non-development related cost incurred was the team and client meetings. With an hourly rate at $26/hour for the
                        client and $20/hour for the team members, the total came to $2232 for a total of $108 hours.

                    <dd>
                        During development in year 0 the total costs came to $11,672, and every subsequent year the cost to maintain the system was
                        estimated to be $2,640 for employee training and maintenance.

                    <dd>
                        A benefit was the elimination of a need for a dedicated staff member to answer the phone. This position required 20 hours
                        per week for half the year, at a rate of $15/hour. This comes to a total of $31,200 over the course
                        of 5 years.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The increase in productivity was the largest benefit coming in at $124,800 in increased sales over the course of 5 years.
                        We projected that with the online ordering system, employees would be able to focus on order fulfillment
                        and estimated 20 cones per hour, with each cone averaging $3.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>Additional benefits include the system keeping track of the flavors that are being bought, which will
                        save time determining the flavors to purchase more frequently. The analytics will also help the manager
                        optimize shift schedules.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Finally, customers will be more satisfied with the convenience of placing an order online, and picking it up without waiting
                        in line. We predict the increased speed will lead to more satisfied customers and repeat business.
                        We project 1,000 customers valued at $10 each, for a total of $10,000 during the 5 year time frame.

                <p>
                Our project resulted in an online ordering form that customers can use to purchase ice cream cakes as well as pints, and
                a client-facing dashboard displaying all the orders. We made all of our major deadlines and accomplished
                our outlined requirements, despite losing a teammate. We kept the interface simple and clean, for ease-of-use
                for both the client and her customers. It was important that her
                <b>older clients who might not have as much technical experience would be able to use the form</b>. The client-facing
                interface was also kept simple to keep it intuitive, so it would be
                <b>easy to train a new employee on the system since Ferris Acres has high staff turnover</b>.
                <br>
                <br> Mrs. Ferris was satisfied with the deliverables, although
                <b>she noted a couple of outstanding issues</b>, including incorporating all of the data onto our solution.
                Mrs. Ferris does not think that the application is ready to go live, as there is currently
                <b>no way to handle payments</b>. She would like to integrate Square with the online ordering system because
                her pick up window is not equipped to process sales. It is also
                <b>important that the orders placed online have been pre-paid</b>, to reassure Mrs. Ferris will be compensated
                for her products.

                <h1>REFLECTION</h1>

            
            <p>
                An online ordering system would be extremely beneficial to the Creamery, as shown through the CBA. Despite all of the challenges,
                I was proud of what we had accomplished. Unfortunately we were
                <b>unable to test a MVP with real customers</b>, but we had created the framework and showed Mrs. Ferris the
                benefit this would have on her business.

                <h3 class="text-spacing">A production level project would require using different tools and different considerations.</h3> At the
                time of the project, the team members did not have enough experience to approach the problem in a way that
                could securely handle payments and be production ready.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>In retrospect, the team benefitted from the sudden departure of a member during the development phase.</b>
                This allowed us to regroup and
                <b>begin testing earlier</b> than we scheduled. By debugging in smaller chunks, I am confident that it led us
                to fewer issues down the road. We were able to easily fix minor bugs before they became giant, complicated
                bugs.
                <br>
                <br> The CBA also seems to be inflated, even after changing some numbers to be more realistic at Mrs. Ferris'
                suggestion. It would be great if we could have
                <b>compared the actual numbers from a production ready system to see how accurate our projections were</b>.
                Regardless, it was interesting to calculate the benefits, and I was surprised at how quickly that number
                added up. I am so thankful to Mrs. Ferris for providing us with this opportunity, making time to give us
                feedback, and letting us sample her ice cream! I learned so much during this time, and couldn't have asked
                for a better team and client.
