                <p>
                    Psychedelicatessen is a breakfast and lunch eatery, serving bagels made from
                    <b>locally-sourced, organic ingredients</b>. The owner, Laura Kerrone has been using an Excel spreadsheet
                    to manage and track her costs but because it cannot integrate with her counter,
                    <b>it does not update in real time.</b> The work must be done done manually, so managing the inventory and
                    cost of each ingredient is difficult. Psychedelicatessen prides itself on locally-sourced ingredients,
                    so it is important to Laura that the system be able to track the inventory by portion size and cost.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-spacing">Her vision is a system that can track inventory usage and waste would help project future inventory needs,
                    therefore reducing cost and waste, streamlining employee workflow, and leading to better service overall.</h3>

                    can be viewed in the next section. I focused in on the inventory subsystem because the problems were
                    unique to this business, and many of the sales features were similar to a generic POS system.

                    The most challenging part was determining how to update the ingredient levels after every order.
                    <b>Each ingredient bought by Psychedelicatessen was converted into portions with the corresponding cost
                        per portion.</b> Portions could look like 2 slices of bacon, 1 egg, or an 1/8 cup of spinach. These
                    portion sizes would be used to create a recipe, and the recipes would become menu items. This way when
                    a customer would purchase a menu item, the system could keep track of the inventory levels, and the cost
                    per item. Additionally, the use of portions makes it easy to track customized orders because employees
                    can add or remove portions with ease.

                I was unable to get feedback from the owner, but I believe this solution fits her business needs. While I was designing this
                system,
                <b>I began to question if an in-house solution was the best fit for Psychedelicatessen.</b>
                There are already inventory management systems and all-in-one POS systems that exist, like Toast and Revel. Both systems
                can create recipes, manage inventory, track waste, generate reports, and handle sales. Pre-existing solutions
                are tried and tested, updated regularly, well supported, and implemented relatively quickly. However it relies
                heavily on the service, and that dependence could be crippling if the vendor is unreliable, or if they need
                to transition to another platform.
                <br>
                <br>Because transaction data is so sensitive, I think it would best to use a trusted off-the-shelf solution.
                <b>Without a dedicated IT team, it would be very difficult for Psychedelicatessen to create and maintain a secure,
                    custom-made system.</b>
                Many off-the-shelf solutions offer some level of customization to the business that could satisfy the needs of Psychedelicatessen.
                <br>
                <br> It is also worth noting that some
                <b>off-the-shelf solutions have APIs that can be used to analyze sales data</b>. This could be a relatively
                <b>quick and inexpensive way to gather more insights</b>. It could be a great project for college students who
                live nearby to implement a dashboard with these insights. For example, a dynamic admin dashboard could be
                created that aggregates waste and inventory levels into one view or a weather API that could be integrated
                to determine if there is a correlation between the weather and type of sales. The possibilities are endless,
                and can be tailored to any future needs that arise.
                <br>
                <br>My final recommendation would be to utilize a pre-existing solution with an API so that the owner can have
                the option of developing customized solutions with relatively low overhead.
