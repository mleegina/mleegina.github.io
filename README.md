# Reflection

This was the third iteration of this site. The first two were very flashy, and while
they were more technically complex, they were less effective at showcasing my work 
and design skills. 

The biggest challenge was working with whitespace, and keeping the design interesting.
My goal was to create a cohesive user experience with some interactive elements. 

- On Hover: When the user hovers over a link, a block of color slides into view 
to highlight the active link. Icons grow on hover.
- On Scroll: When the portfolio links are in the viewport, a class is added so that they animate and 
slide up into view.
- On Load: The headings fade and slide into place using CSS3 keyframes.
